# Analyze-A-B-Test-Result
**For this project, I was working to analyze the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website to help the company understand if they should implement a new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
The project consists of three parts to make useful statistics:


Part I - Probability

Part II - A/B Test

Part III - Regression**
